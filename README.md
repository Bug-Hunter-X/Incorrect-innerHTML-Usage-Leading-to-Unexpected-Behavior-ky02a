# Uncommon HTML Bug: Premature innerHTML Modification

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to using `innerHTML` in JavaScript before the target element is fully parsed into the DOM. The bug occurs when you try to modify the content of an element using `innerHTML` within a `<script>` tag placed *before* the element in the HTML structure.  The browser may not yet have created the element when your script attempts to access it, resulting in a runtime error or no change occurring.

## Bug Description:
The primary issue here is the order of execution.  The script runs before the element `#myDiv` is fully rendered, causing `document.getElementById('myDiv')` to return `null`, and thus the `innerHTML` operation fails silently. This can be particularly hard to debug as the error might not be immediately apparent.

## Solution:
The simplest solution is to ensure that the script modifying the element appears *after* the target element in the HTML file. This guarantees the element exists when the JavaScript attempts to modify it. Alternatively, you can place the script at the bottom of the `<body>` tag or wrap the code in a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener.
